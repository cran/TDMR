Editing the 2 .html files (changes.html, index.html) in this dir: 
	- Write / edit it as plain HTML text file with the help of SELFHTML (http://de.selfhtml.org).
	- Only then we reach full W3C conformance when checking HTML with W3C validator (http://validator.w3.org/) as it is required by Email Kurt Hornik 27.07.2014.
	- changes.html was generated from the MS-Word-saved .html file by 
		- simply removing all informations in <head>...</head>,
		- replacing <o:p></o:p> by nothing
		- replacing <u> ... </u> (underline) by <strong> ... </strong>.

The 2 .pdf files in this dir come from Douc.d/Sweave.d/
	- TDMR-docu.pdf: minimize file size with Adobe Acrobat prior to package build
	- TDMR-tutorial.pdf: DON'T minimize file size (would result in bad-quality images)

%%%%%%%%% OLD AND DEPRECATED %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Editing of all 3 .html files in this dir:
	- Open in Word
	- Save as type "Webseite, gefiltert" and NOT as "Webseite"

(Otherwise TDM-docu.html as part of the TDMR-package will NOT be displayed properly!! And the others are bigger than needed.)
